Project Explanation:
This project is a simple time conversion and mealtime identification program. The user is prompted to input a time in the format ##:## (24-hour format), and the program converts it to ##.## (decimal format). After the conversion, it determines the mealtime associated with the converted time, such as breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

Files:

main.py: Contains the main logic of the program.
README.md: Documentation file explaining the project and how to use it.
How to Use:

Run the program by executing main.py.
Enter the time in 24-hour format when prompted.
The program will convert the time and identify the corresponding mealtime.
Example:

python

# main.py
def main():
    # This is the user input to handle
    time = input("What time is? ")

    # Convert from ##:## to ##.##
    time_c = convert(time)

    # This is the cycle to handle the action linked to hours
    if "7.0" <= time_c <= "8.0":
        print("Breakfast time")
    elif "12.0" <= time_c <= "13.0":
        print("Lunch time")
    elif "18.0" <= time_c <= "19.0":
        print("Dinner time")
    # Add more conditions as needed for other meal times

def convert(time):
    hours, minutes = time.split(":")
    # Perform the conversion
    minutes_float = round((float(minutes) / 60) * 1.0, 2)

    # Convert float to a string and eliminate the leading 0.
    minutes_c = str(minutes_float).replace("0.", "")

    # Join the two parts
    time_c = ".".join([hours, minutes_c])

    # Return the converted time
    return time_c

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Note:

The convert function is responsible for converting the time from the ##:## format to ##.## format.
The main function then uses the converted time to determine the mealtime based on specified conditions.
