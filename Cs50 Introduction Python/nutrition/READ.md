#Calorie Counter for Fruits
This simple Python script allows users to input a fruit and receive information about its caloric content. The dictionary contains a variety of fruits along with their corresponding calorie counts per 100 grams. The user is prompted to input a fruit name, which is then converted to lowercase for case-insensitive matching. If the entered fruit is found in the dictionary, the script displays the caloric information.

##Usage
Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter the name of a fruit when prompted.
The script will output the caloric content of the specified fruit, if available.
