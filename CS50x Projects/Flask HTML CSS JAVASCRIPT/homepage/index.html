    <p>The atmosphere of Mars is quite different from that of Earth. Here's a brief description:
    </p> <p>
            <ol>
                <!--I want to make an order list-->
        <li><strong>Composition:</strong></li>

        Main Components: Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide (about 95.3%), nitrogen (2.7%),
        and argon (1.6%).
        Trace Gases:There are trace amounts of other gases such as water vapor, oxygen, and methane.
        Pressure and Density:
        <li><strong>Pressure:</strong></li> The atmospheric pressure on Mars is about 0.6% of Earth's sea-level pressure. It varies with altitude
        but is generally much lower than on Earth.
        <li><strong>Density:</strong></li> Due to the lower pressure, the density of the Martian atmosphere is also significantly lower than
        Earth's.
        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong></li> Mars experiences extreme temperature variations. Average surface temperatures hover around -80
        degrees Fahrenheit (-62 degrees Celsius). However, temperatures can range from about -195 degrees Fahrenheit
        (-125 degrees Celsius) near the polar caps to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) in equatorial regions
        during the day.
        <li><strong>Seasons:</strong></li> Mars has distinct seasons like Earth, but they are about twice as long because of its longer orbit
        around the Sun.
        <li><strong>Dust Storms:</strong></li> Mars is known for large dust storms that can cover the entire planet. These storms can last for
        weeks to months and affect visibility.
        <li><strong>Wind:</strong></li> The thin atmosphere allows for high winds on the Martian surface, leading to the erosion of rocks and the
        formation of sand dunes.
        <li><strong>Limited Weather Phenomena:</strong></li> Due to the low pressure and lack of significant water vapor, traditional Earth-like
        weather phenomena such as rain, snow, or clouds composed of water are rare on Mars.
        <li><strong>Potential for Human Exploration:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Breathability:</strong></li> The low pressure and lack of oxygen make the Martian atmosphere unsuitable for human breathing.
        Astronauts would need life support systems to survive.
        <li><strong>Radiation:</strong></li> Mars' atmosphere provides less protection against solar and cosmic radiation compared to Earth's
        atmosphere, making radiation exposure a concern for human exploration.
        Understanding the Martian atmosphere is crucial for planning future manned missions to Mars and provides
        insights into the planet's geological and climatic history.
